### Key Components

- **MumbleViewModel**: Central state management, connects UI to service
- **MumbleService**: Background service maintaining Mumble connection
- **AudioFeedbackManager**: Handles roger beep and audio notifications
- **SerialPttManager**: USB serial adapter integration for external PTT
- **MumbleConnectionManager**: Network connection handling and protocol
- **VuMeter**: Real-time audio level visualization component

### Development Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data layers isolated
- **Reactive Programming**: StateFlow for reactive state management
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Jetpack Compose component model
- **Testability**: ViewModels and business logic unit testable
- **Performance**: Efficient state updates, lazy loading, proper lifecycle management
